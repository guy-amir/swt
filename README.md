# VisualizingNDF
The repository contains pre-processed images, pre-trained models and code for visualizing deep neural decisoin forest: 
1. The classification models for MNIST and CIFAR-10 are released. 
2. Pre-processed CACD dataset is released.
2. A model trained for CACD dataset is released, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and comsumes less memory. 

Finally, this repository is version 1.0 with more comments to write.

## Decision making for Facial Age Estimation
Note how the irrelevant texture (e.g. hair) is ignored by the model during the decision making process.

## Accuracy on Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD)
| Model             | Error        | Memory Usage | FLOPs
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [DRFs_CVPR 18'](https://github.com/shenwei1231/caffe-DeepRegressionForests)    | 4.637      | 539.4MB | 16G
| [RNDF (Ours)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10737)             | 4.595      | 112.4MB | 4G

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 (not tested for other versions)
* PyTorch 1.0 
* CUDA (Yet using CPU is possible if you want to modify the code)

## Pre-trained models
You can download the pre-trained models at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DM6wVSknkYBqGf1UwHQgJNUp40sYDMrv?usp=sharing and place them in the "pre-trained" folder.

## Visualization for Image Classification
After downloading the pre-trained models, go to /src and
simply run 
```bash
python ndf_vis.py 
```
for CIFAR-10.

For MNIST, run 
```bash
python ndf_vis.py -dataset 'mnist'
```
## Visualization for Facial Age Estimation:
To visualize NDF for CACD dataset:
1. Download the pre-processed images at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBu62cpnaMl5EX8EsjfEenRVv9rk3trt/view?usp=sharing and decompress it into the "/src/data" folder.
2. Download metadata folder at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s_Ml82O4FVkC34PCE4ttrYhta3EKeYdo?usp=sharing and place it under the "/src/data" folder.
3. Go to /src/age_estimation and run
```bash
python ndf_vis.py 
```
Sorry about the hard-coded paths and few comments. Please refer to the similar classification code for detailed comments for now. Future updates will introduce more comments.

## Training for Image Classification
To train a deep neural decision forest for CIFAR-10, use 
```bash
python main.py
```
For MNIST, run 
```bash
python main.py -dataset 'mnist' -epochs 50
```

## Training for Facial Age Estimation
The training and testing code for facial age estimation will be released in a future update.
